# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  

This project demonstrates a comprehensive **data warehousing and analytics solution**,  
from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights.  

Designed as a **portfolio project**, it highlights **industry best practices**  
in data engineering and analytics.
---------------------
## 🧩 Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with three key layers — **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**.

### 🥉 Bronze Layer
- Stores **raw data** as-is from the source systems.  
- Data is ingested from **CSV files** into the SQL Server database.  
- No transformations are applied at this stage.

### 🥈 Silver Layer
- Performs **data cleansing, standardization, and normalization**.  
- Transformed data is stored in clean, structured tables ready for analytics processing.

### 🥇 Gold Layer
- Contains **business-ready data** modeled into a **Star Schema** or **Flat Table**.  
- Optimized for **reporting, analytics, and visualization** in BI tools.
-----------------------
## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution**, showcasing modern best practices used in enterprise data engineering.
